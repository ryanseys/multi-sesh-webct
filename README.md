A Firefox &amp; Chrome extension that enables multiple sessions in Carleton Uâ€™s WebCT

For use by specifically Carleton University students, this extension will allow you to open multiple sessions of WebCT within the same browser session. Usually WebCT permits a maximum of ONE session open at a time.

### How To Use

Simply log into WebCT in one tab, and click the Carleton WebCT logo button which will open a new tab where you will be allowed to log in another time without closing the current session.

**NOTE:** You can repeat this as many times as you would like, just ensure you are FULLY logged in (page has fully loaded) before pressing the button to make a new session.

### Known Issues

**Issue:** If you refresh a session's page with multiple sessions open, it will display the regular "Error: Session Already Running" page.

**Fix:** Avoid clicking refresh. If you do, simply click the extensions button and start a new session.

Please report any additional errors or bugs you find to me!
